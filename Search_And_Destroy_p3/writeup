P(T found in i | T was not found in i) = P(T will found in i ^ T was not found in i) / P(T was not found in i)

T found in i = T in i ^ Successful check of i

P(T in i ^ Successful check of i | T was not found in i) = P(T was not found in i | T in i ^ Successful check of i ) * P(T in i ^ Successful check of i) / P(T was not found in i)

P(T was not found in i | T in i ^ Successful check of i ) = P(T was not found in i | T in i)

= P(T was not found in i | T in i) * P(T in i ^ Successful check of i) / P(T was not found in i)
= P(T was not found in i | T in i) * P(T in i) * P(Successful check of i | T in i) / P(T was not found in i)\
= terrain * prior (1-terrain) / P
