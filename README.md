# CS440_AI
CS440 AI Rutgers project (group: Shivank, Sam, James) 

Each project has a written report for more details

1. Fire Maze - environment where agent is required to navigate through a maze with obstacles. At each time step with some predefined probability, open cells in the maze catch on fire adding further complexity to the agent's search for the optimal and safest path.
- used A* and custom developed heuristic to stay away from the fire cells and find the optimal path.

2. Mine Sweeper - agent designed to play mine sweeper
- primary concept: knowledge representation, linear algebra, and drawing logical conclusions from knowledge

3. Search and Destroy - agent is left in a 2d array and is tasked to find the hidden object. At each cell there is a certain probability of whether the agent would succesfully be able to find the object even if it searched.
- primary concept: probability algorithms

4. Color: Color the right half of a black and white image given the black and white and colored version of the left half
- primary concept: parallel programming, NumPy, Logistic regression (sigmoid)
